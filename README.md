# Application-Specific Super-resolution CNN based on DenseED blocks
This repository includes the code used for the geenration of super-resolution of microscopy images training using the small data (a small training dataset and really useful for biomedical applications like X-ray, MRI and in vivo imaging). 

# Motivation: 
Figure shows the tradeoff between dataset size and performance: 
1. Show the requirement of the SR datasets

2. Show the illustration of the ML model (tradeoff between training dataset size and performance metrics)

3.Tradeoff of ML methods performance metrics vs training dataset size

# Datasets: 
1. W2S dataset (open-source dataset)
2. BPAE dataset (custom-built two-photon microscopy)

# Sample dataset images: 
1. W2S dataset samples (experimentally captured diffraction-limited (using widefield microscopy setup) and super-resolution images (SIM microscope setup))
![](Results/dataset_sample_images/training_dataset.jpg)
2. BPAE dataset samples (experimentally captured diffraction-limited (using two-photon microscopy setup) and super-resolution images (computationally generated using SRRF method))

# Abalation study of the trained ML model
1. MSE loss of different denseED configurations (varied number of layers in each denseED block by keeping same number of dense blocks for the whole experiment)
