# Super-resolution CNN based on DenseED blocks
This repository includes the code used for the geenration of super-resolution of microscopy images training using the small data (a small training dataset and really useful for biomedical applications like X-ray, MRI and in vivo imaging). 

Datasets: 
1. W2S dataset (open-source dataset)
2. BPAE dataset (custom-built two-photon microscopy)

Diffraction-limited image: (BPAE sample from test dataset: FOV8)
